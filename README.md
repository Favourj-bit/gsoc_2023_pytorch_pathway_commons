# Project Description
The aim of the project is to develop an example dataset that will be compatible with Pytorch Geometric. This dataset will be created by integrating datasets gotten from cBIo datahub and Pathway Commons. The data integration process will require combining the two datasets to create a single, comprehensive dataset. The integrated dataset will then be used to train GNN models for downstream tasks.
The proposed solution involves a three-stage process: retrieving and preprocessing data from the datasets, integrating the data, and developing and training Graph Neural Network(GNN) models on the integrated dataset.
